# Aimless

## Purpose
Aimless hopes to allow its users to read about topics they normally wouldn't normally be drawn to, expanding on the `Special:Random` functionality by adding cohesion between pages.

## How does it work?
Aimless groups together articles of the same category, and traverses through the Wikipedia category graph randomly in regular intervals.

## How does it use Wikipedia?
Aimless comes with a simplified form of the Category Tree, so it will only access `Special:RandomInCategory`.
